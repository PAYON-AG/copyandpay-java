# mavenServlet

minimal integration of COPYandPAY using a maven project with Servlets and jsp.

## Usage

Prerequisites: This guideline assumes that you have Eclipse with a maven plug-in (m2e), egit and Java >= 1.6 installed.

### Import the project to Eclipse: 

In "Git Repositories" view, rightclick on the mavenServlet-folder -> import projects -> import existing Projects -> Finish

### Run the project:

Rightclick on project in the eclipse package explorer -> Run as -> Maven build -> enter in Goals: tomcat:run 

Call it on http://localhost:8080/mavenServlet/payment

## Developing

* *PaymentServlet.java* does step 1 of the tutorial: it creates an order and dispatches to the payment.jsp
* *payment.jsp* does step 2 of the tutorial: reads the order's id as a request attribute and displays the payment page
* *StatusServlet.java* does step 3 of the tutorial: receives the redirect of the user after payment. It calls a GET on /orders, evaluates the response an dispatches to the paymentSuccess.jsp or paymentError.jsp.
